For example if  $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, then it's a pair $(a,b)$, such that $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and also $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For example $(1.5, 2.0)$.\n",

In this number is just a nonnegative integer, that's okay. A 10-dimensional vector space is just a vector space in which 10-dimensional vectors live.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have the term vectors, we can -- for example -- compute distance between them. So **searching for the most similar document** (given some **query term-vector**) boils down to looking for the (geometrically) nearest vector!\n",

You have a query e.g. \"cats playing with dogs youtube\", which is converted to a term-vector (see below) and the best-matching document (text in a website, textual description of a video) is returned.
